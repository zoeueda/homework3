	<h1>Miso Ramen Recipe</h1>

<blockquote>
        <p>Ramen is originally from China and arrived in Japan during the nineteenth century. When you're in Japan, you will quickly learn that there are 3 basic ramen flavors: Shio (salt), Shoyu (soy sauce), and Miso (fermented soybean paste). </p>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li> Mince the garlic, ginger and shallots </li>
		<li> Grind seasame seeds, leavign some seeds unground for texture </li>
		<li> In a medium pot, heat sasame oil over medium-low heat and add the moinced garlic, ginger, and shalllot.</li>
		<li> With a wooden spatula, tir fry until fragarant </li>
		<li> Add the meat and increase heat to medium. Cook the meat until no longer pink. </li>
		<li> Add spicy bean paste (La Doubanjiang) or non-spicy bean paste (Doubanjiang) and miso. Quickly blend well with the meat before they get burnt. </li>
		<li> Add the meat and increase heat to medium. Cook the meat until no longer pink. </li>
		<li> And add the ground sesame seeds and sugar and mix well. </li>
		<li> Add sake and chicken stock, and bring it to a simmer. </li>
		<li> Taste your soup and add salt (if necessary) and white pepper. Each chicken stock varies in saltiness, so you have to taste your own soup to decide how much salt is necessary. </li>
		<li> Cover with the lid and keep the ramen soup simmered while you cook noodles.  </li>
		<li> Bring a large pot of unsalted water to a boil (ramen noodles already include salt in the dough). When water is boiling, take some hot water into serving bowls to warm up the bowls (and drain before adding cooked noodles). Loosen up the fresh noodles.  </li>
		<li> Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. I usually cook the noodles al dente (about 15 seconds earlier than suggested time). </li>
		<li>When noodles are done, quickly pick them up with a mesh sieve. You don’t want to dilute your soup, so make sure to drain the water well. Serve the noodles into bowls. </li>
		<li> Add the ramen soup and top with various toppings you’ve prepared. </li>
	<div class="laststep">
		<li> Place the toppings of your choice and serve immediately!</li>
